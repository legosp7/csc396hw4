Assignment 4 is in HW4

The code expects the file to be in the same directory. It splits it into training/testing.

I was not able to completely generate the contextualized embeddings, due to the very long time it took to train (Over 20 hours and counting). I tried to make the subset smaller but it still is taking too long. 

The logic of the code should check out though, hopefully. Feel free to run it on a faster machine to check it out.
